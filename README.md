# Medical-Expenses-Prediction-Using-Linear-Regression

The dataset shows demographic statistics from the US Census Bureau for the medical expenses of patients. Various factors are considered which are used for prediction.

The steps for prediction are:

1) Loading/Reading the data from the local drive.
2) Cleaning the data to clear out the anomalies.
3) Exploring the categorical and numerical data using proper data visualization steps.
4) Creation of correlation matrix.
5) Creation of scatterplot matrices to visualize the correlated variables.
6) Training the model using Linear Regression Algorithm.
7) Adding non-linear relationships to improve the model.
8) Rerunning the model to get better predictions.
